Tool 1B: get_readmission_insights
-----------------------------------
Analyzes a patient's visit history to assess readmission risk.

Readmission Risk logic:
  LOW      — 0-1 visits in 90 days AND no recurring diagnoses
  MODERATE — 2 visits in 90 days OR recurring diagnoses
  HIGH     — 3+ visits in 90 days, OR recent discharge (<30 days) with recurring diagnoses

Run independently to test:
